# WhatsApp New Pricing 2023: Conversation Based Pricing

WhatsApp will officially release the [new pricing in 2023](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing) on **June 1, 2023**. Businesses using the WhatsApp Business Platform will be charged per 24-hour conversation, with different rates by conversation category.  

**Business-initiated conversations** will be split into three new categories: utility, authentication, and marketing. Meanwhile, **user-initiated** conversations will be called service conversations.

Before these new prices went into effect on June 1, 2023, there were several updates for the previous months.

### April 1, 2023: New Template Categories

There is [template migration](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing/launch-timeline#template-category-validation) by WhatsApp from the existing category to new one because [starting June 1](https://support.qiscus.com/hc/en-us/articles/16853465385113-WhatsApp-New-Pricing-2023-Conversation-Based-Pricing#h_01GWGXDGTW3QX3SCRBA097RB8B), the rates charged will be based on the conversation category. Therefore we advise you to check out the template categories starting from April 1, 2023. You can refer to the [template category guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing/new-template-guidelines) to understand the differences between each template category.  

There are three new categories for business-initiated conversations:

- **Utility conversations** - Facilitate a specific, agreed-upon request or transaction or update to a customer about an ongoing transaction, including post-purchase notifications and recurring billing statements
- **Authentication conversations** - Enable businesses to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges)
- **Marketing conversations** - Include promotions or offers, informational updates, or invitations for customers to respond/take action. Any conversation that does not qualify as utility or authentication is a marketing conversation.

If you disagree with the category that WhatsApp assigned a given template, you can appeal the categorization to WhatsApp through our [support team.](https://support.qiscus.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) The template categorization appeal process closed on May 15, 2023.  

Please note that categorization appeals submitted will not affect a template's status. If your template was already approved when you submitted an appeal, it will remain approved even if WhatsApp rejects your appeal (and it retains the category WhatsApp assigned it).

### May 15, 2023: Template Categorization Appeal Process Closed

WhatsApp closes the template categorization appeal, what does it mean for you? it means the template category that has been migrated by WhatsApp cannot be changed anymore.  

### June 1, 2023: New Conversation Rates

The conversation rates are now based on the conversation category. Businesses can initiate a conversation using a template message. The category of the template message used will define the conversation category.  

At the same time, starting June 1, user-initiated conversations which help customers resolve inquiries will be categorized as service conversations. This doesn't affect conversations that occurred before June 1. Additionally, Free session is used for user-initiated conversations only.  

Under the new rates, Marketing conversation rates will be more expensive than Utility conversations. Meanwhile, the rates for Authentication conversations are still coming soon. You can download rate cards [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing) for more details about the changes to the new WhatsApp pricing. Related to this change, Qiscus Conversation-Based Pricing (CBP) will be updated soon.
